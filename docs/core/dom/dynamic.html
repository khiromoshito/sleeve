        Sleeve was originally based on the concept of 
        reactive web programming with state management.
        It is the framework's building block, and the 
        most important aspect of its architecture.

        <br><br>

        As a brick to the whole foundation, Sleeve introduces
        <b><i>dynamic elements</i></b>, or elements that can contain
        direct JavaScript code and update itself whenever triggered.

        <br><br>

        This solves the problem of displaying <i>dynamic values</i> 
        (values that change) and values dependent from a JS
        execution. Take a look at the example below, displaying
        the value of a variable.

        <br><br><br>

        <div dynamic>{{showPreviewCode('dynamic-1')}}</div>

        <br><br>

        Add <code mode="html">dynamic</code> as an attribute to make an element dynamic.
        Then, JavaScript codes can be embedded by enclosing it with double curly brackets:
        <code mode="html"> {{ //YourJSCodeHere }} </code>, and it can be placed anywhere
        within the element (on the tag or within the children), as many as one heart's desire.


        <br><br>Here's another example.

        <br><br>

        <div dynamic>{{showPreviewCode('dynamic-2')}}</div>
        
        <br><br><br>

        <h5 section="manual">The JavaScript Way</h5>
        Manually, you can instantiate a dynamic element with the 
        <b>Dynamic</b> class, like this one:
        
        <br><br>

        <block-code mode="js">
            var dynamicElement = new DynamicElement(element);
        </block-code>

        <br><br>

        You can then process the element and its script by calling
        the <code mode="js">update</code> method.

        <br><br>

        <block-code mode="js">
            var dynamicElement = new DynamicElement(element);<br>
            dynamicElement.update();
        </block-code>

        <br><br>



        It's that simple. 

        <br><br>
        
        But then, the samples above were still static. The element and its
        dependent values were just updated once (as the element was displayed).
        <br><br>
        In order to fully grasp the state management capacity of dynamic elements,
        Sleeve presents a handy object that can handle changes on its value 
        and automatically update dynamic elements dependent to it.

        <br><br>

        Presenting, the <a href="state.html">State</a> objects.
        
        <br><br><br>

        <div class="block-warn">
            <b>Warning:</b> Dynamic elements inside dynamic elements (or <i>dynamic descendants</i>) are not allowed.
            Either make the parent dynamic, or not, by specifying which descendants can be dynamic.
        </div>

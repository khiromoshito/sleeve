        Sleeve is a front-end web framework for building highly flexible webpages. 
        It acts like an extension to HTML, with 
        <code mode="html" style="word-break: normal;">&lt;semantic elements></code> and special attributes
        for crafting dynamic user interface.

        <br><br>

        This is a newly-developed framework. Its first commit was on <i>February 15, 2020</i>,
        and until now, this project is still under progressive development. Sleeve is open source,
        and you can contribute to the codebase as well. The full project repository (including this documentation)
        can be found <a href="https://github.com/khiromoshito/sleeve-docs">here</a>. 
        

        <br><br>

        Sleeve has been developed to help overcome difficulties in developing reactive, responsive web pages. 
        Sleeve is composed of two components that build up the whole framework:
        <br><br>
        <div responsive style="display: flex; margin: {{R(0,20,25)}}px; flex-direction: {{R('column', 'column', 'row')}};">
            <div style="flex: 1; margin: 25px">
                <strong>CORE</strong><br>
                For the DOM manipulations, state management and routing
            </div>
            <div style="flex: 1; margin: 25px">
                <strong>Sleeve-Suit <i>(User Interface)</i></strong><br>
                For widgets, semantics and responsive layout
            </div>
        </div>

        <br><br>

        The core component provides features for structuring the page, while Suit manages the design. 
        Both execute for a dynamic web application.

        <br><br>
        Sleeve is built to be semantic to make the codebase much more readable and easily manageable. 
        Below is a basic scaffolding architecture with Sleeve-Suit.
        <br><br>

        <block-code mode="html">
&lt;scaffold>
    &#9;&lt;navbar>
        &lt;navbar-left>
            &lt;img src="favicon.png" />
        &lt;/navbar-left>
        &lt;navbar-right>
            &lt;nav-links>
                &lt;a href="home.html">HOME&lt;/a>
                &lt;a href="contact.html">CONTACT&lt;/a>
                &lt;a href="signin.html">SIGN IN&lt;/a>
            &lt;/nav-links>
        &lt;/navbar-right>
    &lt;/navbar>
    &lt;sidebar>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
        Pellentesque porttitor, magna quis ultricies ultricies, 
        ex ex accumsan nulla, eget blandit elit nisl sed metus. 
        Phasellus pretium arcu vel libero consectetur, 
        id placerat metus varius. Mauris id mauris nec diam 
        facilisis luctus. Maecenas luctus congue faucibus. 
        Phasellus tristique rutrum accumsan.
    &lt;/sidebar>
    &lt;main>
        &lt;h3>Lorem Ipsum&lt;/h3>
        &lt;h6>John Doe&lt;/h6>
        &lt;br/>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 
        Pellentesque porttitor, magna quis ultricies ultricies, 
        ex ex accumsan nulla, eget blandit elit nisl sed metus. 
        Phasellus pretium arcu vel libero consectetur, 
        id placerat metus varius. Mauris id mauris nec diam 
        facilisis luctus. Maecenas luctus congue faucibus. 
        Phasellus tristique rutrum accumsan.
    &lt;/main>
&lt;/scaffold>
        </block-code>
        
        <br/>
        <br/>

        Sleeve also has a powerful DOM manipulation, 
        and most of it does not require writing JavaScript. 
        Sleeve core makes use of the HTML element itself to
        host DOM manipulations. Just adding a simple attribute or two,
        and the element becomes alive.
        
        <br><br>

        Here is a simple snippet that iterates an element 100 times.

        <br/>
        <br/>

        <div dynamic>{{showPreviewCode('intro-iteration')}}</div>

        <br><br>

        Sleeve's approach aids web development to be faster, 
        more efficient, flexible and scalable. Powerful as it can be,
        Sleeve supports JavaScript-ing directly in HTML elements (core)
        and even in CSS (Sleeve-Suit). And there's more of the features to 
        know of. Sleeve is simply made to become productive.
